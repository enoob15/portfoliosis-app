# Portfoliosis - Project Summary

**Technical Lead**: Devon Cross, CTO
**Date**: January 15, 2026
**Status**: Phase 2 (AI Engine) - Week 4 Start

---

## 🚀 Current Status: Weeks 2 & 3 Complete

**Milestones Achieved (Jan 11, 2026):**
- ✅ **Authentication**: Full login/signup flow with Email/Password & Google OAuth.
- ✅ **Database**: Supabase schema deployed with Row-Level Security (RLS).
- ✅ **Dashboard**: Portfolio management interface with draft/published states.
- ✅ **File Upload**: Secure drag-and-drop resume upload (PDF/DOCX) to Supabase Storage.
- ✅ **Infrastructure**: Next.js 15 + Shadcn UI + Supabase fully integrated.

---

## 📋 What We Have Built

### 1. Core Platform Application ✅
- **Authentication**: Secure auth flow using Supabase Auth (Middleware protected routes).
- **Dashboard**: `app/(dashboard)` layout with navigation, user settings, and portfolio lists.
- **Wizard**: 3-step creation flow (Details -> Template -> Upload).
- **Storage**: RLS-protected storage bucket for user resumes.

### 2. Database Architecture ✅
- **Tables**: `users`, `portfolios`, `ai_jobs`, `templates`, `portfolio_versions`.
- **Security**: Robust RLS policies ensuring users only access their own data.
- **Triggers**: Auto-updating timestamps and user management.

### 3. Type System & Components ✅
- **Types**: Comprehensive TypeScript definitions in `types/`.
- **UI**: Full suite of accessible Shadcn UI components.
- **Upload**: `ResumeUpload` component with validation (type/size).

## 📅 Next Steps (Phase 2: AI Engine)

### Assigned to: James Chen (AI Lead) + Devon Cross (CTO)

**Goal**: Transform uploaded resumes into structured data and generate portfolio content.

**Immediate Tasks (Week 4):**
1.  **Resume Parsing**: Implement `pdf-parse` and `mammoth` to extract text from uploads.
2.  **AI Orchestrator**: Build the service to route requests to LLMs (OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini).
3.  **Prompt Engineering**: Design prompts for structure extraction and content enhancement.
4.  **Profile Generation**: Map extracted data to the `Profile` type structure.

**Deliverable**: Upload a resume -> View extracted & AI-enhanced profile data.

## ⚠️ Critical Risks & Mitigations

### 🔴 HIGH RISK: AI Cost & Latency
**Status**: Monitoring
**Mitigation**:
- Using "Flash" and "Mini" model variants for bulk processing.
- Implementing aggressive caching for parsing results.
- **Action**: Verify API key quotas before starting high-volume testing.

### 🟡 MEDIUM RISK: Resume Parsing Accuracy
**Status**: Active
**Mitigation**:
- Hybrid approach: Rule-based parsing for structure + LLM for semantic understanding.
- User verification step (Human-in-the-loop) before generating the final site.

## 🛠️ Technical Decisions (Updated)

### ✅ Supabase for Everything
**Decision**: Consolidated Auth, DB, and Storage into Supabase.
**Result**: Simplified architecture, zero-config RLS security, free tier sufficiency for MVP.

### ✅ Server-Side Operations
**Decision**: Heavy use of Next.js Server Actions.
**Result**: Reduced client-side JavaScript, improved security (secrets stay on server), faster initial loads.

## 📈 Project Health

### ✅ GREEN (On Track)
- Authentication & Database foundation is solid.
- Dashboard UX is implemented and functional.
- Documentation is up-to-date.

### 🟡 YELLOW (Monitor)
- **Deployment**: Vercel deployment needs final verification of environment variables.
- **AI Keys**: Need to ensure API keys are provisioned in `.env.local`.
