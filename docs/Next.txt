  🎯 Mission Results

  Web Dev Team (Maya) ✅

  - Fixed wizard bug
  - Started dev server (running on localhost:3001)

  - Status: Components built and ready

  AI & Automation Team (James) ✅

  🔴 CRITICAL BLOCKER FOUND

  The wizard is NOT connected to the dashboard!

  File: components/dashboard/OnboardingWizard.tsx:51-55

  Currently shows this placeholder:
  {step === 'manual' && (
      <div className="max-w-md mx-auto text-center py-12">
          <p className="text-lg font-medium">Manual Entry coming soon</p>
          <p className="text-gray-500">For now, try uploading a resume to get started.</p>
      </div>
  )}

  Impact: All those beautiful components exist but users can't access them!

  Fix Required: Replace placeholder with the actual wizard component (~1 hour)

  📊 Other Issues Found

  High Priority:

  - Database migration not applied yet (needs manual execution)
  - Zero test coverage
  - LocalStorage security concern (personal data unencrypted)
  - No browser back button warning

  QA Recommendation:

  2-3 days to production-ready OR 8.5 hours for MVP launch (with beta label and close monitoring)
